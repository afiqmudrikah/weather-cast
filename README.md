## General Approach

- Find an API that provides the data needed.
- Planning the structure of the app interfaces.
- Install necessary dependencies.
- Create components needed for the application.
  - To display the current and five-day weather forecast.
  - Navigation bar to include the use of routes.
  - User input component to get the location.
- Decide the placement of the different states.
- Introduce functions to add functionality.
- Utilize asynchronous functions to fetch data.
- Manually test the app after every implementation of new features.
- Add final styling to the different components.

## Problems faced

- Limited API calls & features for the base service.
- App renders before it receives data from the API.
- Incorporating dynamic components to the app.
